Module 1: Login and Authentication Management
Overview
Module 1 handles user authentication and role-based access control for the Smart Apartment Maintenance System. Since the system is designed as an in-memory backend simulation, authentication is implemented using core Java data structures without any database or external identity provider.
This module ensures that only authorized users can access system features based on their assigned roles (Resident, Maintenance Staff, Admin).

Key Responsibilities
    • User registration and in-memory credential storage
    • Secure login validation
    • Role-based authentication and access control
    • Session simulation for logged-in users
    • Logout and session termination

User Roles
The system supports the following roles:
    • Resident – Can raise complaints, view complaint status, and receive notifications
    • Maintenance Staff – Can view assigned complaints and update resolution status
    • Admin – Can monitor all complaints, manage users, track SLAs, and view analytics
Each user is associated with exactly one role at the time of registration.

Authentication Flow
    1. User submits login credentials (username and password)
    2. System validates credentials against in-memory user store
    3. If authentication succeeds:
        ◦ User session is created
        ◦ Role is loaded into session context
    4. If authentication fails:
        ◦ Access is denied
        ◦ Appropriate error message is returned
No persistent session storage is used; sessions exist only during runtime.

In-Memory User Store
    • User data is stored in thread-safe collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap)
    • Passwords are stored in hashed form (basic hashing for simulation purposes)
    • User objects contain:
        ◦ User ID
        ◦ Username
        ◦ Hashed password
        ◦ Role
