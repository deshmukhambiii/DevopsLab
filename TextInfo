Module 5 — Admin Monitoring & Metrics

(Detailed Explanation — Java In-Memory System)

📌 Purpose

The Admin Monitoring & Metrics module provides analytical insights into the apartment maintenance system.
It helps administrators monitor system performance, evaluate SLA compliance, detect problem patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

Unlike other modules that perform actions, this module focuses on analyzing system data stored in memory and generating real-time reports and metrics.

🎯 Key Objectives

Monitor overall complaint activity

Measure system efficiency and SLA compliance

Identify recurring maintenance issues

Evaluate staff performance and workload

Support management decisions using analytics

🧠 Core Responsibilities
1️⃣ Generate Complaint Statistics

This feature calculates high-level complaint trends such as:

Total number of complaints

Complaints grouped by:

Month

Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)

Category (Plumbing, Electrical, Security, etc.)

Resident

Example Metrics:

Complaints per month

Open vs Closed complaints

Growth or decline in complaints over time

Java Logic:

Uses Java Streams to filter, group, and count complaint data stored in memory.

2️⃣ Track SLA Compliance Rates

This feature analyzes whether complaints are resolved within SLA deadlines.

SLA Metrics:

Number of complaints resolved on time

Number of SLA breaches

SLA success rate (%)

Average resolution time

Maximum delay recorded

Computation:

Compares:

Complaint creation time

Resolution time

SLA threshold from Module 3

Value:

Helps admins identify:

Performance bottlenecks

Delays in maintenance response

3️⃣ Identify Most Frequent Issue Categories

This function detects common recurring problems.

Example Insights:

Most frequent complaint category (e.g., Plumbing = 40%)

Repeated issues by building or floor

Seasonal trends (e.g., more water complaints in monsoon)

Java Logic:

Group complaints by category

Count occurrences

Sort results in descending frequency

Business Impact:

Helps prioritize preventive maintenance planning.

4️⃣ Produce Snapshot-Based Admin Reports

The module can generate real-time snapshot reports representing the system state at a given moment.

Snapshot Includes:

Total complaints

SLA compliance rate

Active vs resolved complaints

Top 5 issue categories

Staff workload summary

Why Snapshot Reports?

Ensure consistent reporting

Avoid real-time data conflicts

Support audits and performance reviews

5️⃣ Staff Performance Analytics

This feature measures staff efficiency in resolving complaints.

Metrics:

Complaints assigned per staff member

Average resolution time per staff

SLA success rate per staff

Pending workload per staff

Purpose:

Detect overworked staff

Reward high performers

Improve workload distribution

6️⃣ Handle Concurrent Reads Safely

Since multiple modules update data simultaneously:

Metrics module supports thread-safe data reading

Uses:

Immutable snapshots

ReadWriteLock

Concurrent collections

Ensures:

No inconsistent metrics

No system crashes

Accurate reporting under load

7️⃣ Handle Partial Data Corruption & Failures

The system is designed to handle imperfect data gracefully.

Failure Scenarios:

Missing timestamps

Incomplete complaint records

Corrupt entries from other modules

Strategy:

Skip invalid records

Log errors

Continue generating reports without crashing
